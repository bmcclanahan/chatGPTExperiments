Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.  (Applause.)  America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.\\nThe years of economic decay are over.  (Applause.)  The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.  (Applause.)  Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\\nIn just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny.  We have totally rejected the downsizing.  We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.  (Applause.)\\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.  Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it’s not even close.  Our borders are secure.  Our families are flourishing.  Our values are renewed.  Our pride is restored.  And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before.  (Applause.)\\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise.\\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.  (Applause.)  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high.\\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.  (Applause.)\\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.  (Applause.)  And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  True.  If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.

(Applause.)\\nThe veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low.  (Applause.)  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.  (Applause.)\\nWorkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.  (Applause.)  A record number of young Americans are now employed.  (Applause.)\\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls.  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.  (Applause.)\\nIn eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce.  In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people — working-age people — have joined the workforce.  (Applause.)\\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent — three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.  (Applause.)  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election.  (Applause.)  This is a blue-collar boom.  (Applause.)\\nReal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.  (Applause.)\\nSince my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible.  This is a record.  It is something that every country in the world is looking up to.  They admire.  (Applause.)  Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.\\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more.\\nJobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts.  (Applause.)  In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.  (Applause.)  This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this.  It’s all working.\\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio.  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family.

He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight.  Tony, keep up the great work.  Tony.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Tony.\\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law.  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.  (Applause.)\\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far.  (Applause.)  With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high.  (Applause.)  We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago.\\nLikewise, we are restoring our nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done.  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built.  (Applause.)  Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA.  (Applause.)  The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is.  (Applause.)\\nOne of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.  (Applause.)  In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President.  Following NAFTA’s adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs.  Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened.  But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.  We did our job.  (Applause.)\\nSix days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.  The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.  (Applause.)  It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity.  We will have that: fairness and reciprocity.  And I say that, finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade.  (Applause.)\\nThis is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions.

This was made possible by the replacement of the disastrous NAFTA trade deal with the USMCA, which created nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, boosted exports for farmers, ranchers, and factory workers, and earned the strong backing of America\\'s labor unions. \\n\\nThis speech'}"

       "[Document(page_content='President Trump:\\nThree years ago, we launched the great American comeback.  Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results.  Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again.  (Applause.)  America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise, and America’s future is blazing bright.\\nThe years of economic decay are over.  (Applause.)  The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us.  (Applause.)  Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\\nIn just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny.  We have totally rejected the downsizing.  We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.  (Applause.)\\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.  Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world — and it’s not even close.  Our borders are secure.  Our families are flourishing.  Our values are renewed.  Our pride is restored.  And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before.  (Applause.)\\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society — one where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise.\\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy — slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements.  (Applause.)  Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high.\\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs — 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.  (Applause.)\\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.  (Applause.)  And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  True.  If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.  (Applause.)\\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history.  (Applause.)  African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.  (Applause.)  African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.  (Applause.)\\nThe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years.  And, last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.  (Applause.)\\nThe veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low.  (Applause.)  The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low.  (Applause.)\\nWorkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.  (Applause.)  A record number of young Americans are now employed.  (Applause.)\\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls.  Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.  (Applause.)\\nIn eight years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce.  In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people — working-age people — have joined the workforce.  (Applause.)\\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent — three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent.  (Applause.)  After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast — and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election.  (Applause.)  This is a blue-collar boom.  (Applause.)\\nReal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.  (Applause.)\\nSince my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible.  This is a record.  It is something that every country in the world is looking up to.  They admire.  (Applause.)  Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.\\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent, and even more.\\nJobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts.  (Applause.)  In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.  (Applause.)  This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this.  It’s all working.\\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio.  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family.  He was homeless.  But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones.  He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight.  Tony, keep up the great work.  Tony.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Tony.\\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start.  This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law.  Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.  (Applause.)\\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far.  (Applause.)  With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high.  (Applause.)  We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago.\\nLikewise, we are restoring our nation’s manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done.  After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built.  (Applause.)  Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the USA.  (Applause.)  The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is.  (Applause.)\\nOne of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.  (Applause.)  In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President.  Following NAFTA’s adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs.  Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened.  But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.  We did our job.  (Applause.)\\nSix days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.  The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.  (Applause.)  It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity.  We will have that: fairness and reciprocity.  And I say that, finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade.  (Applause.)\\nThis is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions.  (Applause.)\\nI also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs.  Our strategy has worked.  Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA.  (Applause.)\\nFor decades, China has taken advantage of the United States.  Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with President Xi.  They respect what we’ve done because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, “That’s enough.”  (Applause.)  Now we want to rebuild our country, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  We are rebuilding our country.\\nAs we restore — (applause) — American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere.  (Applause.)  That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.  (Applause.)\\nWe are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy.  The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.  (Applause.)  Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people.  But Maduro’s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.\\nHere this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans.  Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó.  (Applause.)  Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Mr. President.  Great honor.  Thank you very much.\\nPlease take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.\\nSocialism destroys nations.  But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.  (Applause.)\\nTo safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military.  (Applause.)  We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it’s all made right here in the USA.  (Applause.)\\nWe are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of Allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.\\nAnd just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces.  It’s called the Space Force.  (Applause.)  Very important.\\nIn the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman.  And what he wants so badly — 13 years old — Iain Lanphier.  He’s an eighth grader from Arizona.  Iain, please stand up.\\nIain has always dreamed of going to space.  He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy.  He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force.  As Iain says, “Most people look up at space.  I want to look down on the world.”  (Laughter and applause.)\\nBut sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all.  Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago.  Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen — the first black fighter pilots — and he also happens to be Iain’s great-grandfather.  (Applause.)  Incredible story.\\nAfter more than 130 combat missions in World War Two, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam.  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.  (Applause.)  A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General.  And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office.  General McGee, our nation salutes you.  Thank you, sir.  (Applause.)\\nFrom the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future.\\nMembers of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.  (Applause.)  The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country.  We must always remember that our job is to put America first.  (Applause.)\\nThe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.  Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools.  To rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships.  The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.\\nOne of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia.  Janiyah.  (Applause.)  Janiyah’s mom, Stephanie, is a single parent.  She would do anything to give her daughter a better future.  But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children.\\nJaniyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery.  Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\nBut, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over.  I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it’s going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.  (Applause.)\\nNow I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received.  Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act — because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.  (Applause.)\\nEvery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow.  For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the BE BEST initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation — online, in school, and in our communities.  Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\nMy administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background.  Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.\\nMy budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools.  Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.  (Applause.)\\nTo expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities.  (Applause.)\\nA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth.  Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years.  I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives.  Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive — and better.  (Applause.)\\nI’ve also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.  (Applause).  And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security.  Always.  (Applause.)\\nThe American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills.  That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency.  (Applause.)  Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform.  (Applause.)  It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\\nBut as we work to improve Americans’ healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely.\\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans.  To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare.  (Applause.)\\nOver 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders.  These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration.  That is what is happening in California and other states.  Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money.\\nIf forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left.  But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens.  (Applause.)\\nThis will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built.  (Applause.)  We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time.  Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed.\\nMy administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies.  We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.  (Applause.)  And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.  (Applause.)\\nAnd working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels.  I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly.  I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices.  Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately.  (Applause.)\\nAUDIENCE:  H.R.3!  H.R.3!  H.R.3!\\nWith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic.  Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.  (Applause.)  Among the states hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent — and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.  (Applause.)\\nProtecting Americans’ health also means fighting infectious diseases.  We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.  My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\\nWe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health.  And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade.  (Applause.)\\nAlmost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness.  Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis.  This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.  Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.  (Applause.)\\nAnd, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  (Applause.)\\nI will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor.  Please.  (Applause.)\\n(The Medal of Freedom is presented.)  (Applause.)\\nRush and Kathryn, congratulations.  Thank you, Kathryn.\\nAs we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs.  In 2017, doctors at St. Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive.  Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter.  Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life.  Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery.  Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight.  (Applause.)\\nEllie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life.  And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive.  It’s an incredible thing.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\\nOur goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie.  That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients.  (Applause.)\\nThat is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.  (Applause.)  Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God.\\nAs we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country.  (Applause.)\\nNow I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation.  (Applause.)\\nForty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit.  (Applause.)  I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether.  (Applause.)  And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality child care, and urge you to act immediately.  (Applause.)\\nTo protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world.  (Applause.)\\nWe must also rebuild America’s infrastructure.  (Applause.)  I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land.\\nI’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet, including and especially in rural America.  (Applause.)\\nA better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe.  That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers.  (Applause.)\\nLast year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.\\nTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens.\\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\\nJust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman.  The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York’s sanctuary policies, he was set free.  If the city had honored ICE’s detainer request, his victim would still be alive today.\\nThe state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants — a very terrible sanctuary — with catastrophic results.\\nHere is just one tragic example.  In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault.  But as required by California’s Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.\\nDays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence.  He viciously shot one man going about his daily work.  He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest.  He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.  He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims.  One of the victims is — a terrible, terrible situation; died — 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones.\\nRocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood.  Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world.  One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight.  Jody, would you please stand?  Jody, thank you.  (Applause.)  Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice.\\nSenator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.  (Applause.)\\nI ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately.  The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.  (Applause.)\\nIn the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers.  And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe.  My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.  (Applause.)\\nBefore I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.  My administration has ended catch and release.  (Applause.)  If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.  (Applause.)\\nVery importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping eight straight months in a row.  (Applause.)  And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly.\\nLast year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz.  Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants.  Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight.  Chief Ortiz, please stand.  (Applause.)  A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.  (Applause.)\\nWith every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. (Applause.)  Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — thank you, Mitch — (applause) — and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written.  This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And we have many in the pipeline.  (Laughter and applause.)\\nMy administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools.  (Applause.)  In America, we don’t punish prayer.  We don’t tear down crosses.  We don’t ban symbols of faith.  We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors.  In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.\\nJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country.  So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  (Applause.)\\nIn reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation.  Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars.  I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts — (applause) — using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.  (Applause.)\\nMy administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)\\nLast week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future.\\nThree years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria.  Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS — the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi — is dead.  (Applause.)\\nWe are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller.  After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker.  She once wrote, “Some people find God in church.  Some people find God in nature.  Some people find God in love.  I find God in suffering.  I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.”  In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself.  After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla.  She was just 26 years old.\\nOn the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room.  He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: “Task Force 8-14.”  It was a reference to a special day: August 14th — Kayla’s birthday.  Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla — and neither will we.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\\nEvery day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart.\\nOne of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.  On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage: “I will be with you again,” he wrote to Gage.  “I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also.  I love you son.  Take care of your mother.  I am always with you.  Daddy.”\\nOn Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.  That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.  Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well.  To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.  He is looking down on you now.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you both very much.\\nThe terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life.  Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.  As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children.  He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq.  Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard.  And that’s why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.  (Applause.)\\nOur message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice.  If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.  (Applause.)\\nIn recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers.  The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people.\\nBecause of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly.  We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery.  It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help.  We are here.  Let’s see which road they choose.  It is totally up to them.  (Applause.)\\nAs we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s wars in the Middle East.\\nIn Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway.  I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent.  It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies.  These are warfighters that we have — the best in the world — and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.  We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home.  (Applause.)\\nWar places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children — six-year-old Elliana and three-year-old Rowan.  Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families.  For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East.  Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months.  Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you.  Thank you, Amy.  (Applause.)\\nBut, Amy, there is one more thing.  Tonight, we have a very special surprise.  I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment.  He is here with us tonight, and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.  (Applause.)\\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Welcome home, Sergeant Williams.  Thank you very much.\\nAs the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes.  This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life.  This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur.  This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more.  This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley.  This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo — (applause) — the beautiful, beautiful Alamo.\\nThe American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth.  Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers.  And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before.  (Applause.)\\nThis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.  We are Americans.  We are pioneers.  We are the pathfinders.  We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.  (Applause.)\\nAmerica is the place where anything can happen.  America is the place where anyone can rise.  And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.\\nThis nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece.  We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.  Our brightest discoveries are not yet known.  Our most thrilling stories are not yet told.  Our grandest journeys are not yet made.  The American Age, the American Epic, the American adventure has only just begun.\\nOur spirit is still young, the sun is still rising, God’s grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come.  (Applause.)\\nThank you.  God Bless You.  And God Bless America.  Thank you very much.\\n', metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"President Obama:\\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\\nTonight marks the eighth year that I’ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I’m going to try to make it a little shorter. (Applause.) I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. (Laughter.) I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. (Laughter.)\\nAnd I understand that because it’s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform -- (applause) -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. (Applause.) So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again.\\nBut tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don’t worry, I’ve got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done. Fixing a broken immigration system. (Applause.) Protecting our kids from gun violence. (Applause.) Equal pay for equal work. (Applause.) Paid leave. (Applause.) Raising the minimum wage. (Applause.) All these things still matter to hardworking families. They’re still the right thing to do. And I won't let up until they get done.\\nBut for my final address to this chamber, I don’t want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future.\\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change -- change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It’s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It’s change that can broaden opportunity, or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.\\nAmerica has been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the “dogmas of the quiet past.” Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America’s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did -- because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril -- we emerged stronger and better than before.\\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation -- our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come.\\nIn fact, it’s that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.  It’s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.  It’s how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.\\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It’s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together?\\nSo let’s talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer -- regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.\\nFirst, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? (Applause.)\\nSecond, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us -- especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? (Applause.)\\nThird, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? (Applause.)\\nAnd finally, how can we make our politics reflect what’s best in us, and not what’s worst?\\nLet me start with the economy, and a basic fact: The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. (Applause.) We’re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history. (Applause.) More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the ‘90s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. (Applause.) That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And we’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. (Applause.)\\nAnyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. (Applause.) Now, what is true -- and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious -- is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit; changes that have not let up.\\nToday, technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.\\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It’s made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.\\nFor the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works also better for everybody. We’ve made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we’ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree.\\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and -- (applause) -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. (Applause.)\\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. (Applause.) No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We’ve already reduced student loan payments to 10 percent of a borrower’s income. And that's good. But now, we’ve actually got to cut the cost of college. (Applause.) Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I’m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. (Applause.) It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)\\nBut a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It’s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. (Laughter.) For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool and they may have to retrain. But they shouldn’t lose what they’ve already worked so hard to build in the process.\\nThat’s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. (Applause.) And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It’s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business, you’ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. (Applause.) And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.\\nNow, I’m guessing we won’t agree on health care anytime soon. (Applause.) A little applause right there. (Laughter.) Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job -- we shouldn’t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he’s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That’s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.\\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I’d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children. (Applause.)\\nBut there are some areas where we just have to be honest -- it has been difficult to find agreement over the last seven years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. (Applause.) And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make.\\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut. (Applause.) There you go! Yes! (Applause.) But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won’t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else’s expense. (Applause.) Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. (Applause.) Immigrants aren’t the principal reason wages haven’t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It’s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. (Applause.)\\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. (Applause.) And I'm not alone in this. This year I plan to lift up the many businesses who’ve figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. (Applause.) And I want to spread those best practices across America. That's part of a brighter future. (Applause.)\\nIn fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?\\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn’t deny Sputnik was up there. (Laughter.) We didn’t argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the moon. (Applause.)\\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better world. (Applause.) That's who we are.\\nAnd over the past seven years, we’ve nurtured that spirit. We’ve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. (Applause.) We’ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more.\\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they’ve had in over a decade. (Applause.) So tonight, I’m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he’s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I’m putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. (Applause.) For the loved ones we’ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let’s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. (Applause.)\\nMedical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. (Applause.) Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely, because you’ll be debating our military, most of America’s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it’s a problem and intend to solve it. (Applause.)\\nBut even if -- even if the planet wasn’t at stake, even if 2014 wasn’t the warmest year on record -- until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? (Applause.)\\nListen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal -- in jobs that pay better than average. We’re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we’ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. (Applause.)\\nGas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad, either. (Applause.)\\nNow we’ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future -- especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going. That’s why I’m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities, and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system. (Applause.)\\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And, yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we’ll create, the money we’ll save, the planet we’ll preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it's within our grasp.\\nClimate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.\\nI told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. (Applause.) Period. It’s not even close. It's not even close. (Applause.) It's not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. (Applause.) No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that’s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead -- they call us. (Applause.)\\nI mean, it's useful to level the set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions.\\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that’s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today’s world, we’re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states.\\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.\\nIt’s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well it means that we’ve got to set priorities.\\nPriority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. (Applause.) Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today’s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out./p>\\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. (Applause.) That is the story ISIL wants to tell. That’s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don’t need to build them up to show that we’re serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world’s largest religions. (Applause.) We just need to call them what they are -- killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. (Applause.)\\nAnd that’s exactly what we’re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL’s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we’re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We’re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.\\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. (Applause.) Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America’s commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. (Applause.) And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. (Applause.)\\nOur foreign policy hast to be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can’t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without al Qaeda, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa, and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn’t pass muster on the world stage.\\nWe also can’t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions. (Applause.) That’s not leadership; that’s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It’s the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now. (Applause.)\\nFortunately, there is a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.\\nThat’s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we’re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.\\nThat’s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. (Applause.)\\nThat’s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. (Applause.) Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million lives were saved.\\nThat’s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region; we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It's the right thing to do. (Applause.)\\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, and set us back in Latin America. That’s why we restored diplomatic relations -- (applause) -- opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. (Applause.) So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the Cold War is over -- lift the embargo. (Applause.)\\nThe point is American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world -- except when we kill terrorists -- or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity.\\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick -- (applause) -- it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we’re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That's within our grasp. (Applause.) And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria -- something I’ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. (Applause.)\\nThat's American strength. That's American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That’s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. (Applause.) It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. (Applause.) There’s a better way. (Applause.)\\nAnd that’s why we need to reject any politics -- any politics -- that targets people because of race or religion. (Applause.) Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness. This is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity, and our openness, and the way we respect every faith.\\nHis Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that “to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.” When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn’t make us safer. That’s not telling it like it is. It’s just wrong. (Applause.) It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. (Applause.)\\n“We the People.” Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we’ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, and that's how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing that I want to say tonight.\\nThe future we want -- all of us want -- opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids -- all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics.\\nA better politics doesn’t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country -- different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That’s one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.\\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn’t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesn’t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise, or when even basic facts are contested, or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn’t matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest.\\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It’s one of the few regrets of my presidency -- that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I’ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.\\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task -- or any President’s -- alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber, good people who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you’ve told me. It's the worst-kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.\\nBut that means if we want a better politics -- and I'm addressing the American people now -- if we want a better politics, it’s not enough just to change a congressman or change a senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves. I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. (Applause.) Let a bipartisan group do it. (Applause.)\\nWe have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families or hidden interests can’t bankroll our elections. (Applause.) And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can’t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution -- because it's a problem. And most of you don't like raising money. I know; I've done it. (Applause.) We’ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. (Applause.) We need to modernize it for the way we live now. (Applause.) This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that.\\nBut I can’t do these things on my own. (Applause.) Changes in our political process -- in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected -- that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That’s what’s meant by a government of, by, and for the people.\\nWhat I’m suggesting is hard. It’s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible, and politics is hopeless, and the problem is all the folks who are elected don't care, and to believe that our voices and actions don’t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don’t look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.\\nWe can’t afford to go down that path. It won’t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world.\\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it -- our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. (Applause.) We need every American to stay active in our public life -- and not just during election time -- so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as black or white, or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not as Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word -- voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.\\nAnd they’re out there, those voices. They don’t get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they’re busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding.\\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open, and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.\\nI see it in the Dreamer who stays up late to finish her science project, and the teacher who comes in early because he knows she might someday cure a disease.\\nI see it in the American who served his time, and made mistakes as a child but now is dreaming of starting over -- and I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters -- and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe. (Applause.)\\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on.\\nIt’s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is, and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he’s been taught. (Applause.)\\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count -- because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.\\nThat's the America I know. That’s the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. (Applause.) That’s what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people.\\nAnd that’s why I stand here confident as I have ever been that the State of our Union is strong. (Applause.)\\nThank you, God bless you. God bless the United States of America.\\n\", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='President Biden:\\nMr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.\\nMembers of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.\\nMr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.\\nAnd you, my fellow Americans.\\nI start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.\\nMr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.\\nI also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.\\nCongratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.\\nAnd congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.\\nAnd I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.\\nThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\\nA story that is unique among all nations.\\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\\nThat is what we are doing again.\\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country.\\nTo restore the soul of the nation.\\nTo rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\\nTo unite the country.\\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\\nWhere is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?\\nFor too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\\nNow, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.\\nInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\\nBut we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.\\nWe have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\\nHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\\nFood inflation is coming down.\\nInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\\nAdditionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\\nEvery time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.\\nAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\\nStanding here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\\nSemiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.\\nAmerica used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.\\nBut in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\\nToday’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.\\nCar prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\\nWe can never let that happen again.\\nThat’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\\nWe’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\\nWith this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\\nThat’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\\nOutside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.\\nThat’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\\nJobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.\\nJobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.\\nAnd it’s just getting started.\\nThink about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\\nTalk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.\\nWe’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\\nBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\\nWe used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\\nNow we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.\\nAlready, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\\nThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\\nUrban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\\nAnd we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\\nAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.\\nI promised to be the president for all Americans.\\nWe’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.\\nThis law will help further unite all of America.\\nMajor projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.\\nOne of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.\\nI went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.\\nWhile I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.\\nFor 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.\\nSara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.\\nThat’s what we’re also building – Pride.\\nWe’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.\\nWe’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.\\nNo parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.\\nAnd when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.\\nNot anymore.\\nTonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.\\nAmerican-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.\\nAnd on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.\\nMy economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.\\nMaybe that’s you, watching at home.\\nYou remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\\nI get it.\\nThat’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.\\nJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\\nFor example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.\\nWill you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?\\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\\nBut, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.\\nNot anymore.\\nWe capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\\nBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\\nLet’s finish the job this time.\\nLet’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\\nThis law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\\nIf drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\\nAnd we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.\\nIt will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\\nWhy wouldn’t we want to do that?\\nNow, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\\nMake no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\\nI’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\\nA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\\nThanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.\\nBut the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.\\nLet’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.\\nLook, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.\\nLowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.\\nI’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.\\nIn addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.\\nNew electric grids able to weather the next major storm.\\nRoads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.\\nClean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.\\nWe’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.\\nAnd helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.\\nHistoric conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.\\nLet’s face reality.\\nThe climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.\\nWe have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.\\nBut there’s so much more to do.\\nWe will finish the job.\\nAnd we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.\\nI’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.\\nAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\\nThe idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\\nThat’s simply not fair.\\nBut now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\\nJust 15%.\\nThat’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\\nUnder my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\\nNobody. Not one penny.\\nBut there’s more to do.\\nLet’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.\\nBecause no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.\\nYou may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.\\nLast year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.\\nIt’s outrageous.\\nThey invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.\\nInstead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.\\nCorporations ought to do the right thing.\\nThat’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.\\nThey will still make a considerable profit.\\nLet’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.\\nInstead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.\\nThat’s being fiscally responsible.\\nIn the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.\\nUnder the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row.\\nBecause of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\\nNearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.\\nHow did Congress respond to all that debt?\\nThey lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\\nThey paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.\\nTonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.\\nLet us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\\nSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.\\nInstead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.\\nThat means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.\\nOther Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.\\nI won’t let that happen.\\nSocial Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.\\nAmericans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.\\nSo tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.\\nThose benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.\\nIf anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.\\nI will not allow them to be taken away.\\nNot today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.\\nNext month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.\\nWe can sit down together and discuss both plans together.\\nMy plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.\\nI won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.\\nIn fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.\\nI will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.\\nLook, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.\\nHere’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.\\nWe’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.\\nMillions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.\\nCapitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.\\nLast year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.\\nI signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.\\nLet’s finish the job.\\nPass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.\\nMy administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.\\nFor example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.\\nWe’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.\\nWe’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.\\nJunk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.\\nThey make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.\\nI know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.\\nNot anymore.\\nWe’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.\\nWe’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.\\nWe’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.\\nWe’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.\\nAnd we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.\\nBaggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.\\nAmericans are tired of being played for suckers.\\nPass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.\\nFor too long, workers have been getting stiffed.\\nNot anymore.\\nWe’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.\\nFor example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.\\nNot anymore.\\nWe’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.\\nI’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.\\nPass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.\\nLet’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.\\nLet’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.\\nAnd by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.\\nLet’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.\\nLet’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.\\nPass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.\\nThese plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.\\nRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.\\nWhen we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.\\nBut the world has caught up.\\nJill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”\\nFolks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.\\nIf you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.\\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.\\nLet’s give public school teachers a raise.\\nAnd we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.\\nLet’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.\\nLet’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.\\nAnd folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.\\nWhile the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.\\nCOVID deaths are down nearly 90%.\\nWe’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.\\nAnd soon we’ll end the public health emergency.\\nBut we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.\\nFamilies grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.\\nWe remember them, and we remain vigilant.\\nWe still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.\\nSo Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\\nAnd as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.\\nBefore I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.\\nLast year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.\\nNow, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.\\nFor every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.\\nCOVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.\\nWe have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.\\nPublic safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.\\nJoining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.\\nBut imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.\\nImagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.\\nI’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.\\nIf a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.\\nImagine having to worry like that every day in America.\\nHere’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.\\nWith faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”\\nImagine how much courage and character that takes.\\nIt’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.\\nWe all want the same thing.\\nNeighborhoods free of violence.\\nLaw enforcement who earn the community’s trust.\\nOur children to come home safely.\\nEqual protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.\\nAnd we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.\\nTo be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.\\nWe ask too much of them.\\nI know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.\\nBut what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.\\nWe have to do better.\\nGive law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.\\nWe also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.\\nMore resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.\\nAll this can help prevent violence in the first place.\\nAnd when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.\\nWith the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.\\nLet’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.\\nAll of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.\\nWe can’t turn away.\\nLet’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.\\nLet’s come together and finish the job on police reform.\\nDo something.\\nThat was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.\\nThank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.\\nThat includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\\nBut we know our work is not done.\\nJoining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.\\nBrandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.\\nTwo weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.\\nHe thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.\\nIn that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.\\nHe saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.\\nBan assault weapons once and for all.\\nWe did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.\\nIn the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.\\nLet’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\\nAnd let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\\nWe now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.\\nSince we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.\\nBut America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.\\nIf you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\\nHere in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.\\nCongress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.\\nThe Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.\\nMake no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.\\nLet’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.\\nOur strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.\\nI spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.\\nA murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.\\nPutin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.\\nWould we stand for the most basic of principles?\\nWould we stand for sovereignty?\\nWould we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?\\nWould we stand for the defense of democracy?\\nFor such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.\\nYes, we would.\\nAnd yes, we did.\\nTogether, we did what America always does at our best.\\nWe led.\\nWe united NATO and built a global coalition.\\nWe stood against Putin’s aggression.\\nWe stood with the Ukrainian people.\\nTonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.\\nAmbassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.\\nOur nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace,\\nnot just in Europe, but everywhere.\\nBefore I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.\\nNot anymore.\\nI’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.\\nI will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.\\nInvesting in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.\\nModernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.\\nToday, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.\\nI am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.\\nBut make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\\nAnd let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.\\nBut in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.\\nAutocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.\\nAmerica is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.\\nAllies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.\\nAnd bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.\\nIt’s never a good bet to bet against America.\\nWhen I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.\\nThat’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.\\nWe’ve made real progress.\\nTogether, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.\\nPassed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.\\nLaunched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer,\\nAlzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.\\nWe passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.\\nBut there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.\\nJoining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.\\nHe wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.\\nHe shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.\\nCourtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.\\nShe was 20 years old.\\nDescribing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”\\nYet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.\\nHe told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”\\nDoug, we’re with you.\\nFentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\\nLet’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.\\nWorking with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\\nSecond, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.\\nWe must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.\\nAnd it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\\nThird, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\\nJob training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.\\nHelping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.\\nAnd we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.\\nThe VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.\\nAnd fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.\\nIt’s personal for so many of us.\\nJoining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.\\nThey met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.\\nKindred spirits.\\nHe wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.\\nShe was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.\\n26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.\\nA 5% survival rate.\\nHe wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”\\nJill and I understand, like so many of you.\\nThey read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.\\nFor them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.\\nThey never gave up hope.\\nAva never gave up hope. She turns four next month.\\nThey just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.\\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.\\nHere tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.\\nMy friend, Paul Pelosi.\\nBut such a heinous act never should have happened.\\nWe must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\\nEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\\nAnd this is our moment.\\nMy fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\\nWe are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.\\nWe must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.\\nA nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\\nWe must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.\\nThat all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.\\nSo I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.\\nBecause the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.\\nAs I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.\\nWe are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing\\nbeyond our capacity if we do it together.\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.\\n', metadata={})]"

       "[\"\\n\\nPresident Trump has overseen an incredible revival of the U.S. economy since taking office, resulting in record-low unemployment, job growth, and poverty levels. African American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low, African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded, and the unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. Under the Trump administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history, and a record number of young Americans are now employed. U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, and consumer confidence has reached amazing new highs. Opportunity Zones are supporting Americans in neglected neighborhoods, providing job opportunities and investments. The USMCA trade deal has created nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and boosted exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. Tariffs imposed to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs have been successful, resulting in a groundbreaking new agreement with China that brings billions of dollars into our treasury and opens up new markets for US-made and grown products. The US has also taken diplomatic action against the Venezuelan socialist dictator, Nicolás Maduro, and created the Space Force, the first new military branch in 70 years. The US has invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the military and NATO members have provided more than $400 billion, while Opportunity Scholarships, vocational and technical education, and funding for historically black colleges and universities have been approved. Additionally, medical costs have been reduced, healthcare plans have been improved, and Americans have been protected from pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is taking on the big pharmaceutical companies, approving a record number of affordable generic drugs, and providing justice to victims of sanctuary cities. This commitment to putting America first has brought about a stronger future for the nation, with a merit-based immigration system, religious liberty, Second Amendment rights, and further investments into national security, the space program, and education. The US has also taken action against terrorism, with the killing of Iran's top terrorist Qasem Soleimani, and supporting the Iranian population in their push for freedom.

       " '\\n\\nIn his final State of the Union address, President Obama called for a focus on the future and encouraged Americans to embrace change and work together for progress on issues like criminal justice reform, immigration reform, and gun violence prevention. He asserted that the United States has the strongest, most durable economy in the world and proposed providing pre-K for all, offering computer science and math classes, making college more affordable, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and providing basic security benefits. Obama also proposed a national effort to cure cancer, the development of clean energy sources, and expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without children. He highlighted that the United States is the most powerful nation on Earth and proposed authorizing the use of military force against ISIL in order to win the war, as well as a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, stop the spread of Ebola in West Africa, and forge a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. He also emphasized the importance of rejecting any politics that targets people based on religion or race, and urged Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba and fund initiatives to fight HIV/AIDs and malaria. In addition, he stressed the need to fix politics by rejecting extreme rhetoric, compromising to find solutions, and allowing every voice to be heard. Obama reminded Americans that they are in control of their collective future, and urged them to uphold their duties as citizens by voting, speaking out, and standing up for others.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nPresident Biden congratulates the new members of Congress, including House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and recognizes Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the greatest Speaker in history. He emphasizes America's progress and resilience when faced with crisis, and encourages a bipartisan effort to continue advancing our nation. He highlights the importance of working together to pass meaningful legislation and make progress, and stresses that the people have made their wishes clear. He outlines his vision to restore the soul of the nation, rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class, and unite the country. He explains how he ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so they can all feel pride in what they do. He touts the success of the Biden Administration in creating 800,000 manufacturing jobs, reducing unemployment to a 50-year low, and decreasing inflation, gas prices, and food inflation. He also emphasizes the importance of leading the world in semiconductor production and making sure America never again runs out of these chips. He also highlights the success of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which have already funded over 20,000 projects and created hundreds of thousands of jobs. He emphasizes that these projects will create jobs that pay $130,000 a year, many of which don't require a college degree, and will help further unite all of America. He is also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America, and capping the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare and every American who needs it. His economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten, and creating an economy where no one is left behind. He is also pushing for the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce utility bills, create American jobs, and lead the world to a clean energy future, as well as expand healthcare coverage and make healthcare savings permanent. He is also calling for the wealthiest and biggest corporations to pay their fair share to help fund these initiatives, such as a minimum of 15% tax rate for billion-dollar companies, a billionaire minimum tax, and a quadrupled tax on corporate stock buybacks. He is also asking Congress to follow suit and commit to the full faith and credit of the United States of America, and is standing up for seniors by promising not to cut Social Security or Medicare.
